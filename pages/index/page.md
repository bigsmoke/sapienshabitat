# Synopsis

_Sapiens Habitat_ – where humans find: 

* shelter in beautiful gardens,
* awe in the spectacular landscapes that connect these gardens, and
* their natural place in the intimidating wilderness that cross-cuts these landscapes.

_Sapiens Habitat_ is a little push to incite sapient beings—you and me:

> to recreate a more friendly, gardenesque version of the paradise in which our
> ancestors survived and thrived, while reserving plenty of wilderness space
> for the continuation of the brutal evolutionary processes from which such a
> sapient species could emerge.

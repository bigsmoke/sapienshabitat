Although the scope of our mission is very grand, Sapiens Habitat's working
strategy is a lot narrower and has been constrained to everything having to do
with ecology and (human) habitat improvement. When involved at the [garden
scale](/scale/garden), this will mostly mean:

* using [permaculture](permaculture) practices and [agroecological](agroecology)
  insights to increase local diversity inside and outside the garden,
* while simultaniously increase (nutritious) output to decrease the dependency
  on far-away produce.

On a [landscape scale](/scale/landscape), the emphasis will shift to:

* ensuring that what remains of wilderness elements is vigerously protected,
* that cultivated lands will be [rewilded](/scope/rewilding) if less than 20%
  of the land is wilderness area,
* and that sufficient space is reserved for [ecological corridors](corridors)
  connecting wilderness (fragments) and other corridors.

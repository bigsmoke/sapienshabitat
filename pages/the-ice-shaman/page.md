# The Ice Shaman, my inner fire, and the rekindling of the wild ape within

“The Ice Shaman.” I couldn't have come up with a better title for Wim Hof myself. Usually, Wim is dubbed the Ice Man, but Russell Brand's “The Ice Shaman” suits him so much better. Whether you see him in interviews or documentaries, as soon as Wim starts coaching anyone in his signature breathing method or through an ice bath, he's more shaman than coach. He may even randomly start chanting, singing and playing the guitar. Some describe him as a force of nature. That's pushing it. Rather, he is aligned to the full force of nature, _and_ he can help me and you re-align too.

Unlike Russell, I never met Wim myself. But, without ever meeting, The Ice Shaman managed to rekindle my interest in the cold. He did that by sheer means of being _out there_, with his Wim Hof Method freely distributed through the Internet, via interviews, and in documentaries. His mission? Healthier, happier people. He may yap a lot about the “scientifically-proven” benefits of cold exposure and breath holding. Especially for the health benefits of breath holding, there is some proof. But, I don't care. What I care about is that he wants people to believe that they are _strong_. I think the most important part of his method—of his unkempt energy—is that he makes people believe. He and his method remind us of something we've long forgotten—something that our parents' parents had for the most part already forgotten. He reminds us that we are _strong_, so strong that we can withstand the freezing cold … in nothing but our birth suit. To me, Wim is undoubtedly The Ice Shaman because he has fully mastered the placebo effect! And that's better than any medicine for most ailments, in particular the ailment of being a weak-willed creature tamed by a homeostasis that is ever too easy to acquire in its luxury cage.

My personal tale of the cold starts not when I first started taking cold showers (which must have been somewhere between the start of the new millennium and the end of the previous one). Chronology fits this story like the clothes you best discard before jumping in the ice-cold water. Instead, this story start quite close to the present, in February of this year (2020), when I visited my brother Jorrit at the [camping in the Dordogne region of France](https://www.termedastor.com/en/) where he has lived on and off since 2005 or so. It had been years since I last visited him and even more years since I last visited him _alone_, for some bro time. (He's my only brother among 5 siblings.)

The plan was that I would carry on my discipline as I normally would: 6 days / week, get up at 6ᴬᴹ; twice daily, exercise, thrice daily, meditate; and semi-daily, immerse myself in the cold. Jorrit had a slightly different routine. His morning ritual: make coffee, roll a cigarette, and sip coffee on the veranda while smoking. His evening ritual: drink, and smoke cigarettes on his veranda while drinking some more.

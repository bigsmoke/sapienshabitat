# The Ice Shaman and the rekindling of my inner fire

“The Ice Shaman.” I couldn't have come up with a better title for Wim Hof myself. Usually, Wim is dubbed The Ice Man, but Russell Brand's “The Ice Shaman” suits him so much better. Whichever interview or documentary he finds himself in, as soon as Wim starts coaching anyone in his signature breathing method or through an ice bath, he's more shaman than coach. He may even randomly start chanting, singing and playing the guitar. Some describe him as a force of nature. That may be pushing it. Rather, he is _aligned to_ the full force of nature, **and** his method can help me and you re-align too.

Unlike Russell, I never met Wim myself. But, without ever meeting, The Ice Shaman managed to rekindle my interest in the cold. He did that by sheer means of being _out there_, with his Wim Hof Method freely distributed through the Internet, via interviews, and in documentaries. His mission? Healthier, happier people. He may yap a lot about the “scientifically-proven” benefits of cold exposure and breath holding. And, especially for the health benefits of breath holding, there is some proof. But, I don't care. What I care about is that he wants people to trust that they are _strong_. I think the most important part of his method—of his unkempt energy—is that he makes people _believe_. He and his method remind us of something we've long forgotten—something that our parents' parents had for the most part already forgotten. He reminds us that we are _strong_, so strong that we can withstand the freezing cold … in nothing but our birth suit. To me, Wim is undoubtedly The Ice Shaman because he has fully mastered the placebo effect! And that's even better than the most cutting edge of modern medicine for most contemporary ailments, in particular the ailment of being a weak-willed creature tamed by a homeostasis that is ever too easy to acquire in its luxury cage.

My personal tale of the cold starts _not_ [when I first started taking cold showers](#cold-showers). Chronology fits this story like the clothes you best discard before jumping in the ice-cold water. Instead, this story start quite close to the present, in February of this year (2020), when I visited my brother Jorrit at the [beautiful camping in the Dordogne region of France](https://www.termedastor.com/en/), where he lingers.

![The story starts here, at Terme d'Astor, a nudist camping in Southern France—Jorrit's home base.](2020-01-31_18.23_Evening_mist_around_the_hill_of_Terme_d_astor.jpg){.text-width width="4032" height="3024"}

The plan was that, vacation or not, I would carry on my discipline as I normally would (try): for at least 6 days per week, get up at 6ᴬᴹ; twice daily, exercise, thrice daily, meditate; and semi-daily, immerse myself in the cold. Jorrit had a slightly different routine. His morning ritual: make coffee, roll a cigarette, and sip coffee on the veranda while smoking cigarettes. His evening ritual: drink, and smoke on his veranda while drinking the opposite of coffee. But something—actually some<strong>one</strong>—a rather lively lady—had rekindled the desire in him to live his life consciously. That spark soon turned into a smouldering fire until he no longer wished to remain knocked unconscious by the various substances he had so long relied on to dull his pain. His cynicism was cracking under the pressure of love—a perfect time, he figured, to invite the wholesome influence of his disciplined little brother.

This o-so-disciplined little brother's daily routine did not survive the onslaught of the two volumes from Robert Jordan's <cite>Wheel Of Time</cite> series that he brought with him. The first morning at Terme d'Astor, instead of bouncing impatiently around my brother's bed at 6 sharp, I was struggling to haul my own grocky ass out of bed, to the coffee machine. And, after a few more nights of “just one more chapter”, I struggled to get out of bed even before noon. The coffee didn't help, although I depended on it to remain wobbling on my feet. Incidentally, coffee is the one drug that Jorrit didn't quit that week. [We both quit a couple of months later.](https://youtu.be/CT1NB7YRedk) Jorrit did quit drinking _and_ smoking, cold turkey. We worked out together. We talked. We talked some more. It had been years since I last visited him and even more years since I last visited him _alone_, for some bro time. And my bro was no longer the cynical ass he used to be. We had some catching up to do. And we meditated. But, most importantly, we faced the discomfort, pain and general unpleasantness of the cold … together.

Here's one part of the story where chronology matters: first, we started facing the cold together; then, Jorrit quit smoking and drinking. He did not quit as a direct result of cold immergence. It had everything to do with wanting to live and wanting a shot at love. And the cold? Helped.

## Blood brothers

When you've decided that you're going to plonge into ice-cold water, you're often not precisely looking forward to it. If _you_ have never taken a cold bath, then imagine: You're standing there. The sun has just gotten clouded over, or maybe you feel raindrops on your naked skin. Yes, you're naked, unprotected. It's winter. Not summer. Not spring. Winter.

![First, you stare into the cold, and the cold stares back into you. “Why?” you feebly ask yourself. But you've already decided.](2020-01-31_Finding_my_courage_at_Terme_d_Astor.jpeg){.semi-text-width width="1200" height="1600"}

![You go into the water, and, as expected, it's quite cold. In fact, it's colder than that.](2020-01-31_Wading_into_the_cold_soft_mud.jpeg){.semi-text-width width="1200" height="1600"}

You walk in. That was the lucky part. Down the wildly forested slope of Terme d'Astor, there's an old loam pond that Jorrit deemed more suitable for our cold adventures than the slick swimming pool that is the camping's proud centerpiece. You could gradually walk into the loam, feet sacking slightly into the muddy, leavy top layer of the loam. Then, when the prickling of the cold in your skin got worse, you can just walk out again, giving your legs the opportunity to heat up.

![Then, you get into the cold, and the cold gets into you. And you let it. You must let it enter you to live. There's your “why.”](2020-01-31_Surrendering_to_the_cold_at_Terme_d_Astor.jpeg){.semi-text-width width="1200" height="1600"}

![When you go all in and the cold gets everywhere, suddenly it's not that bad anymore. While you're letting go of your resistance to the cold, you're simultaneously freed from your resistance to living.](2020-01-31_Fully_immerged_in_the_cold_loam_pond.jpeg){.semi-text-width width="1200" height="1600"}

After postponing the inevitable encounter with the cold until a few days after my arrival, we finally got in. Our first joint encounter with the cold was squeamish. But we got in. And it was glorious.

<iframe title="If you have a problem with nudity, you're in the wrong place. This is a nudist camping. And we're naked apes. You are too, regardless of your attempts to cover up the truth of you nakedness." src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNRyN0NH49c?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="1" data-aspect-ratio="0.75"></iframe>

The following days we went deeper—not deeper into the pool; there's wasn't really a “deeper” there; we went deeper into our physiology, until we felt our Viking blood boil. We drew from a strength that we both forgot we possessed. There was no time for the folly of thought. Never had I felt so strongly what it means to share blood with your brother. We went wild—unleashed—and smashed at the bars of our cages. We smashed at each other, yelling boisterously, growling, pushing each other. Even our labrador companion went crazy and started to jump excitedly, eager to join in the energizing, aggressive joy of wanting to live and experiencing that your blood is stronger than the elements of nature. We became an element of nature ourselves in that moment. And the labrador had to be thrown on his back by Jorrit to curb its frantic biting, pawing energy when his “pack” woke up from the humdrum of isolation from the elements. As a rule, dogs never avoid the cold water. So why do we? Why are we so addicted to homeostasis? Why are we generally so lame? If it feels so fantastic to feel the strength of your blood, why don't we?

## What's that smouldering still deep inside me? {#cold-showers}

I've long had a love-hate relationship with comfort. Once, I wrote a poem called “Far below luxery lives beauty”, and I quite meant it despite it being a shitty poem. I started experimenting with cold showers around the turn of the century, because there was something in there that I felt I needed, and I think it took me a year—maybe two—before I decided to henceforth only take cold showers. Why? I think I wouldn't have been able to give you an honest answer at the time. When pressed, I would have said ① that warm water made my skin dry and itchy. At its worst, it gave me eczema and dandruff. ② Cold water is more refreshing and woke me up feeling way more energized. Plus, I discovered ③ that cold water is in many places where hot water isn't. When you get used to cold showers, you can even just hose yourself down with any old garden hose when there's no shower around. And the closest I came to the truth was when I said ④ that no matter how crappy I feel about myself, when I place myself under a cold shower, there's a sense of accomplishment.

The honest answer would have been ⑤ that the cold briefly made me feel alive, while most of the rest of the time I wasn't even sufficiently attuned to my feelings to feel the numbness inside.

Yet, there was an enormous difference between taking a cold shower (which, when you get used to it, is usually quite pleasant and refreshing, especially after exercise) and fully immerging yourself in cold water. This difference in intensity makes itself most particularly felt when the cold water is situated outside in unpleasant weather.

If I had been aware of ⑤—that the unpleasant aspect of the cold actually had something to teach me—I might have not fallen off of the bandwagon of cold exploration. I must emphasize that at this time I was self-driven to explore the cold. I did not yet know (or, at least, hardly knew) about Wim Hof, and definitely his method hadn't yet caught on in a way that it had become visible to me. I was fumbling along by my own compass.

Cold immersions never felt quite as good as cold showers. Sometimes, it felt nice and tingly for a while to then soon turn to terrible. Other times, it started deeply unpleasant, then a warm glow would come over me, but, out of the water, I would become yellowy blue and shivery. When I was just washing myself in a little stream in December, it felt good. But, the first time I tried swimming in November in the Netherlands, I could hardly even close the zipper of my coat afterwards.

After about 10 years of cold showers and the occasional full immergence, I fell off of my practice in my early thirties, because I felt that ⓐ  I wasn't making any progress, ⓑ  what proof did I have that this was actually doing me any good, and ⓒ  wasn't I just inflating my ego with my “toughness”?

Then, after a couple of years of just showering at whichever temperature I felt like, I started to notice that, when diving, where I used to be fine diving in December in a wetsuit, I was finding it more and more difficult to handle the cold. The cold just seemed to have gotten colder! It couldn't have really; the North Sea water doesn't usually drop below 5 – 6°C in winter; so it was I who was changing … in the direction of soon needing a dry suit. Indoor swimming pool water turned daunting without a “shorty”—a partial 5mm wet suit. What was next? Turning up the heat in my living room by 5°C, as if I was among the elderly? It annoyed me, which I attributed to my narcissistic ego ⓒ. In the cold seasons, I still needed the occasional cold shower to avoid itchiness and eczema ①, but I didn't much listen to this nagging—smouldering—voice that told me that I shouldn't let myself get too dependant on environmental homeostasis. “I should be able to be comfortable wherever, shouldn't I?” I ignored the inner voice, because it felt like the enlightened / socially supple thing to do. The competing voice was stronger: “Don't try to be so special. Just take warm showers like everybody else. It's okay to be soft and weak.”

## It's not supposed to get comfortable, me fool!

This smouldering inside of me turned into a small flame when on some Wim Hof interview/documentary binge, I heard him say that he hates the cold. Huh?! I was confused. Or rather, I had been confused all that time! I measured my progress by how comfortable the cold got for me. I should have measured it by how well I could handle the discomfort! The point is to voluntarily get out of my comfort zone. And, yes, getting out of your comfort zone does tend to extend it, but that is not the main point. The main point is that it's okay to be uncomfortable. It's okay even to feel terrible.

![Poor man's ice bath. April, 2017.](2017-04-23_Snorkling_in_an_ice_bucket.WhatsApp.jpg){.narrow width="900" height="1600"}

So I got back to it, with the limited means at hand. Clearly, cold showers wouldn't cut it (especially in summer). Thus I turned to the use of mopping buckets with blocks of ice and a snorkel. The nearest lake was not so near and the “after drop” loomed ever too intimidating over the prospect of having to cycle back home while reduced to a blueish yellow heap of shivers.

A year later, near my home in Groningen, the City designated a dead-ended stretch of canal as the official “City Beach”. They dretched out all the deceased bicycle wrecks, gave it the stamp of “cleanest water in the city” and dumped some wagonloads of beach sand next to it. With the last of my excuses (distance to open water) gone, I decided at the end of the summer of 2018 to “just keep swimming”.

It was rather tough to keep at it throughout the winter of 2018/2019 and I did so only spottily. I soon had to admit that to actually swim would get me warm (if I swam quite intensely), but would distract me from actually interfacing consciously with the cold. I would literally swim away from it and then be hit extra hard when time came to get out of the water, all blue and yellow. Marilisa tried convincing me that instead of swimming I should hang on to the entrance ladder. When I finally started listening, I indeed had to admit that this was a better practice to become aware of and face the cold. If ever there was a metaphor for life:

> I had to stop trying to get away from the discomfort and pain.

Exemplary of how much I was not ready to face the pain is how I kept beating myself up that cold season that I wasn't doing it frequently enough. That made it more difficult/painful/agonizing to keep on swimming or be in the water at all for more than a few minutes. In other words: I just kept waiting for it to get easier. And I felt like I ruined my chance to _ease_ into the cold while autumn and then winter progressed. I refused to understand that there was no need to get to a stage where I didn't experience the cold as such.

> The whole point was and is to _fully_ experience that cold, no matter how unpleasant, no matter how uncomfortable. The purpose is feeling. Feeling is what separates the living from the dead.

Also:

> Life is not a rehearsal. It's here now.

Life is taking place right here, right now.

So, much of the 2018 to 2019 cold period, I was a near-complete pussy. Then, in early 2019, there was another glorious opportunity: we would go to Portugal, to Annemarie and Laurelin [their property](/and-take-your-plants-with-you/), through which runs a very fresh, very idyllic stream.

## Flu flight

The days before our flight, Marilisa was almost completely flattened by one of the seasonal flu viruses. Fever, headache, the whole shebang. Yet, I talked her into boarding a flight with me to Portugal. I thought her virus was in remission, and I thought myself immunized from it by rigorous exercise and cold showers. The virus was not impressed. The airplane air conditioning signed my verdict: I landed with a searing throat, and I was to get sicker and remain sick during our whole stay in Portugal. As if that wasn't enough,  we infected my mother and brother as well. Apart from 2 brief immersions, this flu completely ruined my chances of using the stream that runs through Annemarie and Laurelin their property for my cold training. Even with combined forces, me and Jorrit took days to prune but a single tree with our sickly bodies. That's how weak we were. I was unable to beat this virus by sheer discipline. I simply had to let it run its course.

Would more rigorous cold training have protected me from falling ill? I think it might, but not for reasons of the magic medical effects of the cold itself. And the word “rigorous” wouldn't come into it. What could have protected me is for the wisdom that's hidden in a innocuous little phrase that Wim Hof likes to use:

> Get deeper into your physiology!

Wim's word here are weak. He's been trying to package his method into scientific-sounding jargon and likes to throw around (rightfully so) the research that has so far been done into the effects of “his” breathing technique and cold training. I've understood that much of this focus on science is the marketing genius of his son Enahm. But… As Wim often tells in interviews, he had been on a long spiritual, esoteric search before he stumbled upon the simple felt truth of the cold. His own frame of reference is more yogic than modern medicine. Something else he likes to say comes closer to the truth:

> Stop thinking your pathetic thoughts!

Our awareness is often so occupied by thoughts and obligations that there's no room left for what is inside the present moment. What is inside the present moment? Definitely not your own physiology. We don't exist on a petri dish with our awareness being able to zoom in and out of our physiological processes at will. We experience ourselves as spiritual beings—we live on a level above the matter from which our consciousness emerges. This has the up- and downside that we do not and cannot experience our physiology directly. If we pay really close attention, we experience what it means to be an embodied consciousness. At the level of consciousness, we don't experience the constituent building blocks (anatomical tissues) or how these interrelate (physiological processes). As a human consciousness, if we are conscious, we experience the flow of energy through our nadis and chakras. We have no direct access to our hormones, blood celss and smooth musculature. The control that we can gain over these is indirect.

Yes, I do believe in chakras and shit. <!-- TODO: insert link to article on chakras. --> Denying that that shit is real is like denying that cells exist. Cells are also just an abstraction of the biochemical processes within them. You cannot usefully describe the emergent properties of the processes making up a cell without accepting that a cell is as real as it can be while at the same time being “nothing more” than an emergent phenomenon. Incidentally, once cells emerged, selection moved from the level of the individual replicator molecules to the level of the whole cell. And the same happened when multicellular organisms evolved. And indeed, you still sometimes have to move back to, for instance, the cell level to understand the evolutionary pressures on sexual reproduction: males don't make sense at all if you just look at the whole-organism level. To understand complex multicellularity at all, you have to move further back, to the DNA-level: all somatic cells sacrifice their chances of reproduction because they share the same DNA as the germ-line cells. More controversially, you have to move yet an emergent level up if you want to understand the rapid evolution of humans and human culture: whole groups of humans can be (and are) wiped out by other human groups if they can't compete effectively. At this level, the individual becomes subservient to the group, because there's no way for individuals to out-compete groups. When group selection takes place, genes can become subservient to memes, and, in fact, in the past 10000 years or so, the human species has fallen victim to a rapid evolution of memes that were ever more effective in combatting other memes regardless of their effectiveness at increasing individual well-being. We got locked in an arms race which required ever more effective resource extraction coupled with agricultural expansion and population growth to achieve military superiority. All those aggressive, dominant meme structures don't care much for our individual health and well-being, as long as we remain functional enough to be able to bear arms and point them at each other.

Yogic memory goes farther back than our Western monotheistic religions do. Yogic tradition recognizes that we've lost something when our ancestors disconnected from wilderness and agriculture started in all earnestness. Our work became more toilsome, more repetitive. One of the big lies of progress is that the agricultural revolution made our lives easier. Not true. The agricultural revolution would never have caught on as a lifestyle if not for superior military pushing power. Run-away game dynamics. Yogi have known that labor alienates long before Marx came along. Maybe they have a deeper memory because for so long horticulture has been (and still is) practiced in what is now India. I don't know. I do know that Western thought has barely gotten over the fact that human life started way before the agricultural revolution; even if we no longer believe the creation myths from the Old Testament, we have safely and securely relegated all that dirty, wild business to “pre-history”, to “before people started doing things that actually matter”, to “before people took their fate into their own hands”. Yoga is a colorful manifold of spiritual paths that recognize that the emergent properties of consciousness depend on the underlying physiology and aims to restore union within the individual, which, when achieved is the same as the union with the whole of which the individual is partial.

## Of waterfalls and streams

Before facing it with my brother, there was something missing from my cold practice. I went about it as a monk. It was a ritual that I wanted myself to undergo, but only for as long and as deep (“into my physiology”) as was necessary to check the box &#9745; and be done. This hadn't be changed even with an official Wim Hof-branded group workshop by Paul Plasman in Groningen City. Bluntly said: I was skirting around the edges of the cold.

The god of the cold, meanwhile, was patiently waiting. Jorrit and I met her in the loamy water at Terme d'Astor in Southern France. Then, we got into Jorrit's car and drove to Portugal, where, in the Ponte de Pedra valley, we met her time and time again, as did our sister and mother. In the rocky stream, flowing through their Portuguese property, there was no getting around communing with the painful simplicity of its cold currents.

![“I defy thee, god of the cold!”](WhatsApp_Image_2020-02-14_at_22.39.46_Defying_the_god_of_cold.jpeg){.text-width width="1616" height="912"}

Nature-technically, of course, there is no god of the cold. There is just cold. Yet, mythologically, the elements are as alive as you and me, and the cold is particularly alive. “Of all the gods, Death only craves not gifts[…]” – Aeschylus, 525 BC – 456 BC. The cold _does_ request its due: you have to offer her your breath—your breath or your life. So, fuck physics. Physics ultimately cause my mental models, but my mental processes aren't modelled around physics. They're modelled around what has meaning. Gods are alive for the very obvious reason that the elements are alive to me. And as soon as you exit the comforts of contemporary live, even temporarily, the gods and all that other dirty mythological business from the past comes rushing right back in! Even your blood suddenly holds more power than its biological constituents (as awe-inspiring as these are in and of itself).

And I speak of gods—plural—because there's no restraining it even to the neat model of monotheism. The cold brings you much farther back, to shamans and animism. The cold becomes an animated force if you surrender to it, in such a pagan way that the medieval Church would try to kill it with fire. The cold imbues the human spirit with the kind of magic that the monotheists and the atheists have sought to destroy. It leads almost inevitably to a kind of faith in the supernatural. What do I mean by that? If you consciously link the natural processes within and without, that in itself is already a kind of magical thinking. Cause and effect get mixed up. You feel in control of things that ought to control _you_. You dare to surrender to things previously thought too harmful to even come near. Basically, you've followed the witch into the forest … and survived to tell the tale. She gave you a gift even—invigorated you. How can you then not end up with an irrational sort of belief in your own power? Ultimately, the placebo effect comes under your conscious control. What awesome power, and what a meagre name for what will be your signature power when you yourself have become an Ice Shaman.

Start with his 1992 <cite>Ishmael</cite> novel, and don't stop there. Too many other authors treat “pre-history” as a prelude to history. The opposite must become true: _if_ humanity has a future, then what we now call “history” must become a side note to the story of the expansion and continued growth of the community of life, told through the eyes of sentient beings. We must continue where we left off at the end of “pre-history”. Don't worry! DQ will make clear what I mean by that.

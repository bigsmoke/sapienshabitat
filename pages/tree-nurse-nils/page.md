# Tree nurse Nils

Nils Zahn is the name of the well-built German holding Laurelin's hand. Do you see the muscle on him? All that bulk is itching to move. And what is movement without direction? Brownian motion. That, in two words, is the challenge of being a highly energetic young man that wants to make a mark on the world. _Some thing_ needs to move, and, if you're not careful, that something will be you, while the world rolls over you. It's extra tough when you're also intelligent and idealistic.

Why am I focusing on this young man and not on his slightly less young girlfriend—my sister—or her (and my) old mother? Because I believe his struggle to be a young man's struggle. I am not saying that the woman around him are not at least equally or more than equally intelligent or idealistic. They are wiser in most aspects of life. Plus, they're more experienced in the skills that are a requisite of their homesteading lifestyle in the hills of Portugal. Certainly, they are more _realistic_. And realism is the reason why I'm writing this for Nils, not them. It is realism that is so damn difficult for us

# Tree nurse Nils

![Nils and Laurelin are standing on the terrace in Ponte de Pedra that will soon thereafter be thoroughly transformed into a tree nursery.](Ponte_de_Pedra_2017-11-12_Tree_Nurse_Nils_and_Laurelin.jpg){.narrow width="1920" height="2944"}

Nils Zahn is the name of the well-built German holding Laurelin's hand. Do you see the muscle on him? All that bulk is itching to move. And, soonish after this photo, he _did_ move … a whole lot of soil, to dig out nice, soft beds for his tree nursery. I should say that the tree nursery is not just _his_; but _he_ is the most caring tree nurse their tree seeds and seedlings could ever wish for.

The tree nursery was the first project in which I was drafted the day after Marilisa and I arrived in the middle of the Portugese dream of the two hobbits on the photo, and that other hobbit. As you can see, it was the start of a sunny day, and my dusty IT bones—cold from the Dutch autumn—would soon be warmed by the sun.

## To nurse or not to Nils

To me, the whole concept of a ‘tree nursery’ was foreign. Sure, I understood that, like any other seed, you can put tree seeds in the ground, and, yes, I would grant you that they might grow a bit faster with some more nutrients. They might then even benefit from some protection against predation. But, that's it. That's about as much thought as I ever gave it. “Nursing trees”? Whatever.

But, they—especially Nils—_had_ gone a bit farther than stuffing some seeds in the ground. There was a plan, and it was evolving—changing to meet a constant stream of new information and insights. Insights abound: from permaculture gurus on the Internet to his old mother-out-law.

![Nils pauses for a moment, unsure how to proceed. He still doubts whether we're creating the best possible seedbed.](Ponte_de_Pedra_2017-11-12_Tree_nurse_Nils_pondering_the_best_next_step.jpg){.text-width width="4032" height="3024"}

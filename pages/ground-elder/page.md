Yet, it is very much at home here, driving many gardeners to despair with its aggressive growth and its inclination to bounce back after even the most thorough erradication efforts. Instead of whithering away, it seems to relish in the negative attention and sweat of hardworking gardeners. Which, in fact, it does.

## _A. podagraria_: a pioneer species

The aggressive growth of _Aegopodium podagraria_ signals its speciality: to compete with other fast-growing species that like to establish themselves in freshly disturbed soils. These are called _ruderal_ species by botanists and other sciency people. ("Ruderal" comes from the Latin _rudus_ (rubble).) Ruderal species have in common that:

* they like newly-tilled soils, so they positively _love_ your hoeing;
* most of them really love to suck on that nitrogen that you overzealously injected everywhere;
* they can take advantage of that nitrogen much quicker than those other plants that you intended it for;
* they tend to disappear over time, when the soil has stabilized; but
* this stabilization period will overstretch your patience.

On top of that, _A. podagraria_ can reproduce vegetatively as well as sexually. For its vegetative reproduction, it appreciates your cooperation; its _rhizomes_—the horizontal stems from which its roots and shoots shoot—can

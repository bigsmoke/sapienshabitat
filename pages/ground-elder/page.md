_Aegopodium podagraria_ (ground elder in common English) is not native to The Netherlands. Yet, it is very much at home here, driving many gardeners to despair with its aggressive growth and its inclination to bounce back after even the most thorough erradication efforts. Instead of whithering away, it seems to relish in the negative attention and sweat of hardworking gardeners. Which, in fact, it does.

## _A. podagraria_: a pioneer species

The aggressive growth of _Aegopodium podagraria_ signals its speciality: to compete with other fast-growing species that like to establish themselves in freshly disturbed soils. Botanists call such pioneers _ruderal_ species. "Ruderal" comes from the Latin _rudus_ (rubble).

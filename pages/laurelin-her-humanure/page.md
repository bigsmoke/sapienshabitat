If you keep flushing your outputs into the ocean, your soil won't thank you, and neither will this grumpy marine biologist; all that nitrogen shit can cause havoc downstream, and the algae will bloom.

## Keep your nitrogen near

We live in nitrogen-flooded times, since the availability of cheap artifical fertilizers revolutionized agriculture around a half-century ago. One of the casualties of this revolution have been the quality of our surface water. Ground water quality has also been affected.

This is not their main concern. Their main house is connected to a sceptic tank, not to the sewer. And although it's a shit, old sceptic tank ([contrary to what they were told](/deceit-or-disinterest/) when Annemarie bought the property), that does mean that their outputs don't end up somewhere downstream.

# Lau her humanure

Laurelin poops. She does so quite regularly, which is a sign of health. That must be why she thought it a waste to just throw all that hearty poop away, as if it wasn't worth a thing. Enter her homemade composting toilet, where all that treasure is collected, in a rather substantial bucket.

![Here, you can see the frame with the bucket, but, as of then (in November 2017), without a s**thole.](Ponte_de_Pedra_2017-11-14_Compost_toilet_frame.jpg){.text-width width="4032" height="3024"}

A composting toilet is a natural signpost on her and Nils' journey of becoming full-fledged permaculture hippies. How else would they ever get close to closing the nutrient cycle? There's only so much shit you can do to keep your outputs from exceeding your inputs. If you keep flushing your outputs into the ocean, your soil won't thank you, and neither will this grumpy marine biologist; all that nitrogen shit can cause havoc—like algal blooms—downstream.

## Keep your nitrogen near

We live in nitrogen-flooded times, since the availability of cheap artifical fertilizers revolutionized agriculture around a half-century ago. One of the casualties of this revolution have been the quality of our surface water. Ground water quality has also been affected.

This is not their main concern. Their main house is connected to a sceptic tank, not to the sewer. And although it's a shit, old sceptic tank ([contrary to what they were told](/deceit-or-disinterest/) when Annemarie bought the property), that does mean that their outputs don't end up somewhere downstream.

But, I am ranting. They're not about to start using artificial fertilizers. Their main priority is keeping nutrients _in_ their system, not so much to keep these nutrients out of other systems.

![Even without the final finishing touches (such as the flap that Laurelin wants to use to connect the shit bucket to the top board) the composting toilet has already served the residents while the [turd of a toilet](/deceit-or-disinterest/) in the main house was being replaced. And it does look neat with the smooth, wooden seat. All it really needed were some fresh feces and urine.](Ponte_de_Pedra_2017-11-20_Compost_toilet_finished.jpg){.semi-text-width width="1200" height="1600"}

## Shit safety

Some poop pathogens are a bit scary. Among the scarier critters are soil-transmitted helminths. Helminthiasis—worm infection—is largely confined to tropical regions, but that is hardly reassuring when [WWOOF](https://www.wwoof.pt/) delivers a dirty dreadlock hippie from Who Knows Which Shit Country at the doorstep.

Not as scary as the worms are the bacteria. Most strains of <i lang="la">Escherichia coli</i>—a particularly well-studied species—are harmless and a part of every healthy person's gut flora, although some strains are serious turd troublemakers. Dispite there only being relatively few pathogenic strains of <i lang="la">E. coli</i> (such as <i lang="la">E. coli</i> O157:H), its ubiquitousness in human feces and its popularity as a model organism in the life sciences makes it _the_ go-to indicator organism for fecal contamination of soils and surface waters. Thus, typically, an <i lang="la">E. coli</i> test will be employed to make sure that the dreaded dready hippie's worms don't end up in the salad.

<i lang="la">E. coli</i> tests are cheap and cheaper tests are [being developed](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0183234) still

Therefore, one should not defacate directly into one's vegetable patch. Laurelin told me that the composting in an open compost pile

<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helminthiasis -->

<!-- Excreta-derived compost recycles fecal nutrients, but it can carry and spread pathogens if the process of reuse of excreta is not done properly. -->

<!-- Internal pathogen destruction rates are usually low, particularly helminth eggs, such as Ascaris eggs.[4] This carries the risk of spreading disease if a proper system management is not in place. Compost from human excreta processed under only mesophilic conditions or taken directly from the compost chamber is not safe for food production.[7] High temperatures or long composting times are required to kill helminth eggs, the hardiest of all pathogens. Helminth infections are common in many developing countries. -->

<!-- In thermophilic composting bacteria that thrive at temperatures of 40–60 °C (104–140 °F) oxidize (break down) waste into its components, some of which are consumed in the process, reducing volume and eliminating potential pathogens. To destroy pathogens, thermophilic composting must heat the compost pile sufficiently, or enough time (1–2 years) must elapse since fresh material was added that biological activity has had the same pathogen removal effect. -->

<!-- One guideline claims that pathogen levels are reduced to a safe level by thermophilic composting at temperatures of 55 °C for at least two weeks or at 60 °C for one week.[2] An alternative guideline claims that complete pathogen destruction may be achieved already if the entire compost heap reaches a temperature of 62 °C (144 °F) for one hour, 50 °C (122 °F) for one day, 46 °C (115 °F) for one week or 43 °C (109 °F) for one month,[5] although others regard this as overly optimistic.[2] -->

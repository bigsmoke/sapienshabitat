# Sweet potatoes and earthworms

The harvest of regular potatoes—as if there is such a thing as a “regular potato”—was largely unsuccessful this year. We don’t know why 2022’s harvest was so bad. (We have some guesses). But, on this sunny November second, we were counting on the sweet potato harvest to make up for the failure of the other tubers.

Indeed the sweet potatoes were in _much_ better shape than the regular potatoes that were dug up mid-August. This is a trend here in the Ponte de Pedra valley. Until I moved to rural Portugal, sweet potatoes were a hipster luxury. In the Netherlands, regular potatoes are abundantly grown. So, for me, it was a pleasant surprise to learn that sweet potatoes are very affordable on the local market in Cernache do Bonjardim, because everybody grows them. Well “everybody” above 50 with a vegetable garden, which is pretty much everybody who lives outside of the town centers (bar a few foreigners such as ourselves), since most youngsters have fled the poverty of the countryside for the lure of a big-screen TV in a tiny, overpriced apartment in Lisbon or Porto. (Actually, a lot of Portuguese spend part of their working life in other, better-paying EU countries.)

The sweet potatoes in our own veggie beds were plentiful, though not as plentiful as they were last year. That year—2021—I wasn’t involved in the planting and the harvesting, but I saw the amazing amount of sweet potato tubers that were dug up by my mother, sister and brother. Yet, in my eyes, as a hipsters who used to pay top euro for the “exotic” sweet potato in Dutch supermarket, on his first sweet potato harvest, the yield was phenomonal.

3 different varieties of sweet potatoes had been planted:

1. The sweet potato plants yielding the most abundant tubers (in both size and number) were of the variety with a Bordeaux red skin and white flesh.
2. A small amount of an orangy-red variety were planted. They produced some decently-size tubers, but not very many—many not even enough to raw conclusions about their suitability for this particular soil and microclimate.
3. A more purplish variety …

In terms of yield, there was a lot of variation between the individual sweet potato plants of each of the 3 varieties. This was most evident for the Bordeaux-red variety to which most of the plants belonged. Some specimens' tubers were hardly tubers at all; instead of glorious, bumpy, bulbous things, such plants only had some elongated bulges.  Others had, in addition, one or twol big bulbs.  A rare few had a whole bunch of big bulbs.  And most had a bunch of mixed-size bulbs.

In previous years, Annemarie—the mom—had experimented with putting some plant parts back into the ground for the subsequent year's planting.  The plants rotted away during the winter due the daily morning frost.  (Remember [that frost that wasn't supposed to happen in this valley](/deceit-or-disinterest/#below-zero)?) <!-- TODO: insert link to one-mill-too-many --> My own ruin to be

# Elderflower bubbles

_[Sambucus nigra]{lang="la"}_ is its scientific name, but I'm more familiar with its dutch name: ‘[vlierbes]{lang="nl"}’. The common name in English for this scrub is elderberry, but we weren't interested in the berries; we were interested in the flowers. So, we went on a little undertaking to a derelict school nearby that was swimming in a sea of white elderflower heads somewhere around the beginning of June.

Having plundered a few plastic shopping bags full of flowers, time came to:

* shake the flowerheads a bit to coax the insects out;
* put them in a nice brew of
    * about 1.7 kg of sugar,
    * a bag (7g) of dried baker's yeast,
    * 2 teaspoons of yeast feed,
    * a few handfulls of cardemon seeds,
    * some lemon juice—we couldn't acquire whole lemons at that time and day—and
    * at least 15 L of water;
* close the fermentation barrel; and
* wait for the water lock to start bubbling.

One thing is for sure: these were many, many more flower heads than in the mix I made with Sanne a few years prior.](Groningen_2017-06-04_Elder_flower_brew_in_bucket_3.jpg){.semi-text-width width="4128" height="2322"}

![Marilisa picked our memories to estimate the relative quantities that went into our first batch of elderflower bubbles, to replicate it into a small second batch. The second batch was on the basis of 3 liters, because there weren't many elderflower heads left to be found a few weeks later.](Groningen_2017-06-25_Post-hoc_notes_by_Marilisa.jpg){.semi-text-width width="540" height="928"}

A lot of carbon-dioxide passed through the water lock. When, after a few days, the baker's yeast stopped noisily pushing CO₂ bubbles through the water lock, we deemed it safe to put our elderflower _sprudelwasser_ into bottles.

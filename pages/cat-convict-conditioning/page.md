# Convict conditioning for cats

Our cats are felons. We don't trust them to conduct themselves properly outside the premises of our flat apartment. Therefore, we keep them locked up at all times, and, besides a few short escapades that ended with scaredly scurrying back up the stair well, they seem to have resigned to their indoors existence. Yet, their intense staring (and tail-wagging) at birds from the window reminds us that they are not, by nature, indoor creatures.

## Exercising the beast

I can think of 3 ways in which the indoor cat's inner beast can get frustrated: ❶ when its hunter-killer instinct is frustrated; ❷ when there are no grassy leafs to get that slimy hairball out their stomach and onto our bed sheets; or ❸ if it can't scratch, climb, and recline in high places.

I didn't want Knabbel or Dinkie to end up bored, fat and lazy (in that order), which

For all their cuddly exterior (and their purring, and their cute, little head bunts), what cats like to do most is to cuddle a crunchy little bird to death between their cute cat teeth. Cats can be cute to their owners, but they are horrible in the way that they torture their prey before finally granting them the mercy of the kill.

But not our cats. They only get to torture the occasional spider or insect, which they then take their sweet time for. We've come to know the macabre meaning of both Dinkie and Knabbel looking with fascination at the same spot on the floor: something is struggling for its life. The horrible truth? We find this _cute_. These murderous machines make us make baby sounds.

Regarding the joy they'd take in hunting and killing, there's little that we can do to help them experience this in our home. I have considered kidnapping juvenile frogs from my father's ponds, but I'm getting raised eyebrows wherever and whenever I pitch the idea of letting frogs loose in the bathroom, and locking them in there with the cats. The closest we get is playing with little balls, wires and what not to let them at least practice their attack. Dinkie likes to play fetch the victim with a little ball, and disemboweling stuffed toys is ranked high as a pastime also for Knabbel.

# Popko's pond

As a child, Popko could always be seen in and around the water—in the swimming pool, or roaming through the wild wetlands of then-Drenthe. Some places where now there are only square, green meadows surrounded by deep ditches, then—60+ years ago—there were extensive fens and bogs. Popko would lose himself in that marshy wilderness for whole days or afternoons, looking for viper, grass snake, smooth snake, slowworm, salamander. His younger brother Hugo would often accompany him.

Hugo suffered child rheumatism on a young age and the doctor prescribed lots of fresh air. In Winschoten—the city where Popko and Hugo grew up—fresh air was scarse. So it was that their father—my grandfather—bought a parcel of land in a young forest that was emerging from the heather fields around Norg (in the northern Netherlands).

Popko dug it by hand, 40 [HOW MANY?] years ago or so.

# Popko's pond

As a child, Popko could always be seen in and around the water—in the swimming pool, or roaming through the wild wetlands of then-Drenthe. Some places where now there are only square, green meadows surrounded by deep ditches, then—60+ years ago—there were extensive fens and bogs. Popko would lose himself in that marshy wilderness for whole days or afternoons, looking for viper, grass snake, smooth snake, slowworm, salamander. His younger brother Hugo would often accompany him.

Hugo suffered child rheumatism on a young age and the doctor prescribed lots of fresh air. In Winschoten—the city where Popko and Hugo grew up—fresh air was scarse. And so it was that their father—my grandfather—bought a parcel of land in a young forest that was emerging from the heather fields around Norg (in the northern Netherlands). Many a weekend and vacation was spent in a newly-erected red brick little house at the edge of what would remain a heatherfield.

Later, in the sixties, as a biology student in Groningen—<i lang="gos">Grûnn</i>, for native speakers like my Popko—he complained to his father that he could no longer stomache the city. He moved to Norg, into the family vaction home, for the rest of the duration of his studies. By bicycle, the distance between “De Schuilplaats” (as the house in Norg was dubbed) and the university's biology and chemistry departments (in and nearby <i lang="gos">Grûnn</i>) was a bit much. Thus, that spoiled brat of a father of mine got to go to university in a Mini Cooper that his father bought for him. Where's _my_ Mini Cooper, dad? 😉

By that time, my mother and father had already met. (Or, as Akash—one of my research supervisors—would have me say: my male (♂) and female (♀) parent already started courtship.) Annemarie, my mother, liked Popko's arms—or rather, the fact that he had arms instead of that incline above the elbow that is still popular among ♂ (not ♀) intellectuals. Having never lost his childhood enthusiasm for aquatic life, Popko used those karate and judo-honed arms to dig a big, deep pond near De Schuilplaats's south-facing brick facade. He moved so much soil that he promised himself to never, ever dig a big pond by hand again.

That was about 40 years ago. Fast forward to 2018—last year—when me and Marilisa were staying in De Schuilplaats.

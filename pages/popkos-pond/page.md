# Popko's pond

As a child, Popko could always be seen in and around the water‚Äîswimming in the public pool, or roaming through the wild wetlands of then-Drenthe. Some places where now there are only square, green meadows surrounded by deep ditches, then‚Äî60+ years ago‚Äîthere were extensive fens and bogs. Popko would lose himself in that marshy wilderness for whole days or afternoons, looking for viper, grass snake, smooth snake, slowworm, salamander. One one his frequent companions on those adventures was his younger brother Hugo.

Hugo suffered child rheumatism on a young age. The doctor prescribed lots of fresh air. In Winschoten‚Äîthe city where Popko and Hugo grew up‚Äîfresh air was scarse. And so it was that their father‚Äîmy grandfather‚Äîbought a parcel of land in a young forest that was emerging from the heather fields around Norg (in the northern Netherlands). Many a weekend and vacation was spent in a newly-erected red brick little house at the edge of what would remain a heatherfield.

Later, in the sixties, as a biology student in Groningen‚Äî<i lang="gos">Gr√ªnn</i>, for native speakers like Popko‚Äîhe complained to his father (my grandfather) that he could no longer stomache the city. He moved to Norg, into the family vaction home, for the rest of the duration of his studies. By bicycle, the distance between ‚ÄúDe Schuilplaats‚Äù (as the house in Norg was dubbed) and the university's biology and chemistry departments (in and nearby <i lang="gos">Gr√ªnn</i>) was a bit much. Thus, that spoiled brat of a father of mine got to go to university in a Mini Cooper that his father bought for him. Where's _my_ Mini Cooper, dad? üòâ

While he was living in De Schuilplaats, my father met my mother. (Or, as Akash Sharma‚Äîone of my research supervisors‚Äîwould have me say: my male (‚ôÇ) parent and female (‚ôÄ) parent started courtship.) Annemarie, my mother, liked Popko's arms‚Äîor rather, the fact that he had arms instead of that incline above the elbow that is still popular among ‚ôÇ (but not ‚ôÄ) intellectuals. Having never lost his childhood enthusiasm for aquatic life, Popko used those karate and judo-honed arms to dig a big, deep pond near De Schuilplaats's south-facing brick facade. He moved such an amount of soil that he promised himself to never, ever dig a big pond by hand again. [He _almost_ held true to that promise. For his next pond, dug in Wagenborgen (in the garden of the rather sizable family home that my grandfather bought for my then-adult-ish and still just-as-spoiled father), most of the blisters and sweat were my brother's. The six ponds _after_ that deserve an article of their own.]

That was then. Fast forward 40-something years, to 2018‚Äîlast year‚Äîwhen me and Marilisa were staying in De Schuilplaats. Popko still joins me there occasionally for garden work and even at 70+ he's still somewhat of a beast with landscaping. It's really not hard to imagine him moving cubic meter after cubic meter after cubic meter of sand. But, for over a decade (since 2006), I've been the main caretaker of the greenery around De Schuilplaats, while my uncle Hugo has taken care of the renovation and maintenance of the house itself and earning the investments back for us through renting it out to vacation-goers.

![April 26, 2018. The hawthorn bushes that obscure Marilisa from sight are awaiting their periodic trim back to the proportions of the fence that their stems are supporting. Marilisa is getting ideas in her head already while looking at Popko's pond, satisfied with all the extra light touching the water after the heavy pruning of the <i lang="la">Rhododendron (ponticum)</i> 2 years prior, in 2016. (Soon, the <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i> would go into its first full purple dress since being robbed of ¬º·µó ∞ of its foliage.)](Schuilplaats_2018-04-26_Marilisa_is_getting_ideas_in_her_head_already.jpg){.text-width width="4032" height="3024"}

![Only a sliver of pond is revealed behind Marilisa, but that sliver is a 100% more than what was visible in 2016 before she severely cut back the <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i>.](Schuilplaats_2018-04-26_Rhododenderon_next_to_pond_and_goofy_M.jpg){.text-width width="4032" height="3024"}

Marilisa, too, has taken to the greenery around De Schuilplaats. We've stayed there once or twice per year since our courtship became serious in 2015. During those stays, initially, Marilisa‚Äîa suitably elf-like helper in such a fairyesque environment‚Äîpreferred to get her projects assigned by me. While her confidence and skill grew, her creative influence began to make its own mark on the garden. Like my father, Marilisa has also always been fascinated with water and what lives inside it. The first thing she had showed me when I first visited her parents was _their_ pond. Popko's pond, then, quickly drew her attention, as soon as she discovered what lay hidden behind that large <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i> bush. So, in 2016, she took the initiative to reduce that <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i> by at least a quarter. (Uncle Hugo was a bit nervous about the severity with which we brought back that luscious purple presence right next to the south terrace, but, in the typical way of <i lang="la">Rhododendrons</i>, it took the bush only 2 years to regain its former fullness and relegate its temporary bareness to the past.) With the <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i> pushed back to humbler proportions, I started, in 2017, with the help of Popko, to clear the mulchy, rich muck from the pond.

Or so I thought. We started at the top, right next to where the <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i> now ended [behind Marilisa in the picture above]. What we did not expect to find was a stair, with steps made out of long-rotten board and field stone. It didn't take long before Popko (already past hist 70th birthday at the time) started attacking peat and <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i> root with more enthusiasm and vigor than myself, overtaken as he was by the mystery of what nature had done to his memories. ‚ÄúThe steps couldn't be _there_.‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm sure they were much farther away from the <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i>‚Äù. We unpealed bucket after bucket of peat made of <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i> leaf, pine needle, pine cone, branch, strung together by root. And, yes, the original stairs that Popko made long, long ago went straight through where thick, tall <i lang="la">Rhododendron</i> stems stood only a year earlier. Yet, at the same time, everything he built was still there, a little displaced here and there, but mostly intact. Nature had prevailed for a long time, overgrowing the memory of one of the most creative parts of Popko's old project. And then part of the veil was lifted, like the removal of a plaster mold, to reveal something that had matured in hiding, in a cocoon.

![The fieldstone steps waited for decades until Popko and I finally released them from their peaty cocoon in the after-summer of 2017. The next spring, in late May, purple <i lang="la">Rhododendron ponticum</i> flower petals, relieved from their reproductive duties, bedded down onto the now-naked field stones.](Schuilplaats_2018-05-23_Rhododenderon_flower_heads_in_pond.jpg){#rhododendron-flower-water .semi-text-width width="3024" height="4032"}

That was when Popko visited Marilisa and me while we were staying in De Schuilplaats in late 2017. I remember how he and I‚Äîespecially he!‚Äîwere slaving away at the rooty peat layer while Marilisa and a friend of Marilisa were sipping tea in the sun on the south terrace. (I'm not sure that they would have enjoyed the show that long if I had kept my shirt on.)

One year later, in November of 2018, the two of us (‚ôÇ and ‚ôÄ) spent a sunny week at De Schuilplaats again. None of the luscious wetness [that had still filled the pond in the late spring](#rhododendron-flower-water) had persisted throughout the extraordinarily long, dry summer. Conveniently, this would allow us to get to the bottom without getting wet. Following the pattern of the previous year, I tentatively took to the pond, aiming only to muck it out to counter the ongoing eutrophication and deepen the base. That was until Marilisa's creative input took the upper hand, and my original, purely ecological, aim became a vague background notion to a much more magical mission.

Congruent with my original intent, we started by removing a fair bit of muck before we got to the more creative part. The muck had to be removed by the bucketload, because the protective fence doesn't allow wheelbarrows to cross. So, we mucked. And we mucked a bit more.

![The base of the pond was flled with a rich, dark mud, made of leaves in various stages of decomposition. Countless pine cones had yet to start rotting in this oxygen-deprived, oft-submerged niche. But rot they will, now that they've been utilized to fertilize Marilisa's new semi-wild <i lang="la">Vaccinium myrtillus</i> patch, among other things.](Schuilplaats_2018-11-13_Digging_the_peaty_muck_from_the_pond.jpg){.semi-text-width width="3024" height="4032"}

![Because it couldn't be wheeled inside the mesh-wire fence, we filled the wheelbarrow one bucket at a time‚Äîa time-consuming process.](Schuilplaats_2018-11-13_A_bucket_with_muck_from_the_pond.jpg){.semi-text-width width="3024" height="4032"}

We weren't going to discard the peaty mud mixture. That would be a waste of such a dense nutrient mass in the sandy, acididic, oligotrophic Norger environment. Rather we applied it to Marilisa's new semi-wild <i lang="la">Vaccinium myrtillus</i> tract, to her artichoke patch, and let the rest decompose further on a pile where some oxygen can get into the blackened leafs and pine cones that were waiting patiently in their submerged kingdom to be turned first into turf and then, just a 

There were 4 major surprises during the deepening of what I then still considered Popko's pond.

## Surprise #0: There's a stair.

Oh, I discussed that one already.

## Surprise #1: The pond's base is reinforced.

I never knew better than that the pond would often dry up completely in the summer, even in the winter sometimes. I did have some hope that clearing out the base would lower the water table threshold at which there would be water left in the pool. But, because the pond isn't lined with plastic, its water level would always change with the ground water level.

Popko knew better. He knew he left a little surprise at the very bottom. It was 40‚ÄØcm deep and a meter by a meter wide. It was more than completely filled with dry sludge. Popko had placed a metal tub at the base of the pond to retain some water even at the lowest ground-water levels.

![Marilisa is attacking the mat of yellow flag (<i lang="la">Iris pseudacorus</i>), that was left hanging in the air above the tub, because the ground had literally been pulled away from under their feet.](Schuilplaats_2018-11-14_Marilisa_fights_the_yellow_flag.jpg){.semi-text-width width="3024" height="4032"}

![There might have could have been water left in the 100√ó100√ó40‚Ääcm tub if there had been any space left prior to our intervention.](Schuilplaats_2018-11-14_We_struck_the_bottom_of_the_pond.jpg){.semi-text-width width="3024" height="4032"}

<!-- TODO: add (SVG?) overlay with measurements -->

## Surprise #2: A field stone slope was hiding under the moss and grass.

The heather-side slope had always just been a source of labor for me. Every year, I freed the sweet-scented Dutch myrtle (<i lang="la">Myrica gale</i>) from sprawling, crawling willow shoots and the always enthusiastic bramble branches. Below these bushes: grass and moss.

When Marilisa started pulling away some of the moss, we learned that

## Surprise #3: The pond is _big_.

## Surprise #4: Is _that_ still drinkable?

## Future surprises

Popko's pond is no longer purely Popko's. For years, I was already removing willow, bramble, Japanese knotweed, and oak. The fence involved yet another input, from Edwin Kielman. But, mostly it was Popko who put something in there these 40 years ago, letting the future twirl through it quite naturally (sometimes in the form of me mindlessly removing the woody plants that are not bog myrtle). Then, Marilisa, with my help, took what time had built and sculpted at it

# A wallflower refuge

Two little brick walls extend from the “De Schuilplaats” its living room onto the south terrace. The low walls both end in thick pillars that supports the roof. This creates an overhang. And below the terrace tiles there's a foundation, which was at some point meant to support a possible extension to the living room. However, the walls ended up just being empty temporary plant pots; occassionally, some blown in seed would germinate into a more or less full-grown plant until it withered away again, usually before the end of the growing season. At other times, a brave soul would plant something—a succulent, if they were smart. But, even succulents would usually whither and dry out. The problem: the overhanging roof keeps most of the rain away from these oblongue ‘pots’. As Bill Mollison would say, “the problem [was] the solution”.

The picture is taken in April of 2012 (with the crappy camera in my Nokia N79), a year after the problem starting turning into the solution.](Schuilplaats%202012-04-04%20Alle%20nieuwe%20muurbloempjes%20van%20vorig%20jaar%20gaan%20bloeien.jpg){.text-width}

The ‘pot space’ between the ‘outer’ and ‘inner’ brick layers was too dry even for most succulents, but not for a flower with the most appropriate name: the wallflower (_Erysimum cheiri_).

I got a few specimen from my mother, who, at the time, had an allotment garden where little wallflower seedlings sprung up everywhere. That was also the first place were I ever encountered them and were I instantly fell in love with their colorful variety.

The little seedling which ended up establishing their own wallflower lineage at “De Schuilplaats” were not the first of my wallflower transplantation experiments. Prior to this 2011 expirement, I tried establishing a wall flower transplantation in my father's garden in Eelde, both seeds as well as seedlings. Only one pair of seedlings took hold there for a while, until my father's Ecuadorian father in law mistook it for a weed. (Only recently did I start to think about the particular places in which these two seedlings survived for a while, but more about habitat selection later…)

Not at “De Schuilplaats”. After a difficult start, during which some of the propagule dried out dispite the occassional watering, the wallflowers in the walls started thriving, no longer requiring any care. Encouraged, I planted some more seedlings and sowed some seeds. Then, after as little as one growing flowering season, the biggest flowering speciment sported its own seeds.

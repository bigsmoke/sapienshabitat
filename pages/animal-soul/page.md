# Wilderness, and why it should be worldwide

<i>Homo sapiens</i>—wise man—has, within a quarter of a million years,
completely transformed the face of earth, the planet on which our species’
lineage diverged from our nearest extant cousins—the chimpansee 13–4 million
years ago. With the recent explosion of our technological prowess, which has
led us straight into the middle of the fifth great extinction crisis, we've
entered what some geologists call the ‘anthropocene’. Besides the ongoing
natural habitat loss and mass extinction of other species, other prominent
features of the anthropocene include:

* that human land-use now dominates the planet, and
* domestic animals form most of the mamellian biomass,
* while the environment is critically polluted by synthethic and organic
  chemicals.

Although our understanding and control of nature has multiplied exponentially,
the human condition hasn't changed much. We still need food and water. We still
need shelter, and we still desire other humans to share food, water and
shelter, and—perhaps—a bed. And then? Then we want beauty, and awe.

## “Anthropocentrically actionable”

In conservation circles, an anthropocentric world-view—a perspective of humankind
as a special species, with the whole world revolving around it—is frowned upon.
Rightfully so; being one among million species invites us to be humble and to
recognize the magnificence of the natural processes that led to our existence.
Whereas the anthropocentric approach, as preached by the big religions, would
have us be the pinnacle of evolution, king of the monkeys, above the rest of
the living world, but not really a monkey ourselves—not even an animal, or even
fully a part of nature. This is an impoverishing view, as it discourages the
fulfillment of our deepest animal needs. Whether coupled to the ideology of
Abrahamic virtue or the ideology of economic progress, anthropocentrism
distracts us from the obvious facts: what we really need to be healthy, happy
animals.  Yes, we're the only animal in denial of our heritage, but that's
because we're the only animal that can be aware of this. In the recognition
of our animal nature lies the distinction that makes us specifically human:

> I am an animal, therefore I am human.

Yet, we _have_ definitely entered the anthropocene, and there's no amount of
wishy-washy thinking about our similarity with other species that can bring the
already extinct species and their habitat back. We need well-informed action if
we are to preserve what's left. But, first we must decide that this is indeed
what we want: do we want to preserve biodiversity? There are plenty of
instrumental reasons to preserve vital ecosystem services, but all this numbers
crunching only serves to reemphasize what freaks we've become to nature, imagining
that we can rationalize ourselves out of the hole that our species struck in 
the earth's ecosystems. Meanwhile, we're still possessed by animal souls. If
these no longer have a dangerous, wild place to roam about, how then are we
expected to feel fully human?

Sapiens Habitat firmly believes that any well thought-out anthropocentrism
should encourage the [rewilding](/scope/rewilding) of nature. Yes, we can have
our protected [gardens](/scale/garden), but outside the garden walls should be
the enrelenting elements of the weather, birth and death, predator and prey.
That is where future generations will go to pray—to feel that they're still
human, there where they're among their animal peers, for once escaping the
smart systems and the safety nets of modern society.

To save the planet, we must first acknowledge that it has already been
destroyed—transformed by the blind, irrational, energetic intelligence of the
human animal.  We're not going to restore it with lesser passions than the
greed for material comfort and power that informed our destructive frenzy.
Sapiens Habitat encourages a passionate “return to nature”,
not out of some vague, uneasy primitivism, but as the pinnacle of our
technological achievement: the long-term project to restore the majesty of
nature as the product of a [sustainable culture of
innovation](/scope/permaculture). At this moment, “without man, there's no hope
for gorilla.” To this quote by the imaginary gorilla in DQ's _Ishmael_ novel,
man should have retorted: “Without gorilla, there's no hope for man.”

# “De Schuilplaats”

<i lang="nl">De Schuilplaats</i> is the Van der Molen family vacation home,
where family members (such as our own [Rowan](/people/rowan) van der Molen)
come to escape the buzzle and buzz of modern city life. To keep maintenance
cost affordable, the house is rented out to tenants during most of the year.

It is situated beautifully at the edge of a private heather field, which
envelops the spacious south terrace. In this locality, without the aid of
grazers such as sheep and cows, the heather will gradually turn to forest.
Indeed, some work by the family is required to keep the heather field open.
Similar effort had to be exerted to reopen the heather field at the other
side—East—of the private road that borders the heather field, separated by a
hedge, North to South.

This open view, unpolluted by the sight of other forest dwellings, may feel
natural in the way it appeals to our [innate instincts about what constitutes
a pleasant landscape](/scale/landscape). In reality, although the Van der
Molens have tried to work *with* the natural processes as much as possible here,
this desire for open space dictates a fight against one of these natural
processes: the process of succession.

## Where the garden slides into the landscape

The goal of the forest garden is to make house guests feel the idyll of the
forest without being encroached by the dark dampness that often accompanies
such forest dwellings. You want to be protected against strong winds, but
not stuck with still, stagnant air. Even in the Netherlands, some protection
against the sun is pleasant during the hottest summer day. To be permanently
in the shade, though, is something else entirely. Therefore, in the way that
a garden directly influences the living climate, there are landscape decisions

# Bramble, ivy and olive

Two of the trees were dead. The veil of ivy and brambles had done them in. The remaining olives were left struggling for light everywhere where the thickly braided bundles of bramble and ivy were progressing on their twisty path through and over the canopy.

They don't know how old the olive trees are precisely, but the olive trees at Ponte de Pedra are old, _and_ tall. Yet, despite their tallness, the brambles had overtook some canopy parts completely. Sometimes these brambles in their turn acted as support for the ivy to also race the olive branches for light.

The olive yard had been neglected for over 50 years. As had much of the valley, to Louis' melancholy. Louis, the neighbour, has lived in the valley long enough to see it degenerate as the young people left for the lure of big city life. The only maintenance the previous owners had had done in the olive yard was to have a few guys with a bush trimmer come in and cut the bramble branches, but leaving plenty of structure for fresh branches to rapidly climb to the top.

I want to emphasize that I have nothing against ivy. In fact, I positively adore it, and I hold similar amorous feelings for bramble. Common ivy is often unjustly accused of ‘strangling’ trees. The truth is that there _are_ vines that can strangle their support (to beautiful effect), but common ivy is not among them.

![Despite the impressive girth of this common ivy trunk, it wasn't strangling the olive. It _was_ aggressively competing for light.](Ponte_de_Pedra_2017-11-15_Olive_yard_18.jpg){.semi-text-width width="3024" height="4032"}

Actually, I did, for the first time in my life, encountered two ivy branches that had conjoined so that they could no longer accommodate growth of the olive branch between them. In other words: I did finally get to witness a common ivy strangling! (Sorry, no pics, so it didn't happen according to the Internet.)

They were restful hours in the olive yard. It was a great place to catch a bit of later afternoon sun after having spent most of an afternoon in the pig sty's clay and cement dust. There was immediate effect of what we did. It was social. Nils had already been there with the bush cutter. I was clambering through the olive tree on my flip flops (occasionally pausing to pull out a thorn). Marilisa was walking around with a rake, collecting the bramble and ivy parts. And Annemarie and Laurelin joined in as well. And when we finished, Jorrit and Nils visited with the chain saw to cut up some fat, fallen tree parts. The neighbour, Louis, took his tractor to bring the wood to the house.

![The bramble pile is on the burn list, because the thorny branches don't make for great mulch if you like to work barefooted or in flip flops (like I do). This separate pile of <i lang="la">Hedera helix</i> parts will make for less pointy mulch.](Ponte_de_Pedra_2017-11-15_Olive_yard_23.jpg){.text-width width="4032" height="3024"}

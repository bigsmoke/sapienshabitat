# Sit still!

The teacher—Meester Beckering, I think he was called—sneaked up behind my chair. Then, a sudden pain where the chair scathed my lumbar region. Annoyed with my childish bouncing in my chair, Meester Beckering had kicked down my chair with his foot. And I did learn to sit still, eventually, until my hips were as stiff as an adult white man's hips are supposed to be, and until my mind was as rigid as … well, something rigid.

I will be writing positive things about my Calvinistic cultural heritage (that I share with so many Northern Netherlanders and others whose ancestors have hung around in North-Western Europe in the past few hundred years), but, not today. Today, I will instead be bitching and moaning about some cultural traits from these same traditions.

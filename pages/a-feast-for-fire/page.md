# A feast for fire – the disaster ecology of the Eucalyptus tree

Portugal is not the only country in which the Tasmanian bluegum is a non-native. Its native distribution was limited to what is now the Australian island state Tasmania and to the southern part of the mainland status above Tasmania: Victoria. The _Eucalyptus globulus_ species has since been spread wider across the continent, and even across the oceans. _E. globulus_ its infection vectors have been its usefulness to humans. Mainly, _Eucalpytus_'s slender, smooth fibers are popular for making soft shitting (and other) paper, and Eucalyptus oil is steam distilled from the leaves. In Portugal in particular, since the 1980s, many, many hectares of former forest and farmland have been planted with Eucalyptus plantations to supply the paper industry with fiber.

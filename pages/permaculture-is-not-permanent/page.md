# Permaculture

From [Rowan](/people/rowan)'s
[thesis](/people/rowan/Biol_BC_2015_RRvdMolen.pdf):
> *Permaculture* (derived from the words ‘permanent’ and ‘(agri)culture’) is a
> design philosophy which applies broadly to any type of sustainable design.¹
> In the narrow sense, permaculture refers to agricultural practices which are
> non-destructive to the soil and overall ecosystem to the extent that vital
> ecosystem services and fertility are left intact, so that the practice can
> continue indefinitely into the future. Although permaculture is a relatively
> new term (Mollison and Holmgren, 1978), traditional formas have existed and
> continue to exist, such as the Kendyan Gardens of Sri Lanka (Jacob and Alles,
> 1987), and *taungya* on Java (Weersum, 1982) and in South China (Menzies,
> 1988).
>
> ¹ When the term ‘permaculture’ was originally coined by Mollison and Holmgren
> (1978), it meant just ‘permanent *agri*culture’. Since then, the term has
> come to more broadly apply to sustainable life-styles and cultures.

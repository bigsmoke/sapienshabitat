# How to flush a stone wall

It wasn't that Laurelin was longing back to her student days: the islands of clothes, inhabited by stuffed animals guarding abandoned books. Maybe she did miss the one island guarded by ‚ÄúFriemframfrutsel‚Äù, but I digress from the point I wish to make: she doesn't long back to living her life in the pig sty‚Äî<i lang="pt">porqueira</i> in Portuguese‚Äîthat her room used to be. However, I am speaking here of a figurative <i lang="pt">porqueira</i>. She very much intends to move into a literal pig sty soon. Well, soon‚Ä¶ Things move slowly around the <i lang="pt">Ponte de Pedra</i> valley. I planted ‚Äúsoon‚Äù here in March 2018. It's now November. And Laurelin has yet to move from the bunk bed in our mother's house to her ‚Äúsoon‚Äù-to-be cozy <i lang="pt" title="‚ÄúPig Sty&#x00A0;2.0‚Äù">‚ÄúPorqueira&#x00A0;2.0‚Äù</i> mini-home. The next stop after <i lang="pt" title="‚ÄúPig Sty&#x00A0;2.0‚Äù">‚ÄúPorqueira&#x00A0;2.0‚Äù</i> cannot be ‚Äúsooned‚Äù by any stretch of the imagination: the 200&#x00A0;m¬≤ water mill, that ‚ìê she [disappointingly](/deceit-or-disinterest/) still has to figure out how to get a building permit for that, and that ‚ìë she then has to turn from a few ruined walls around a big pile of rubble into something ‚Ä¶ else. So, by that measure, <i lang="pt" title="‚ÄúPig Sty&#x00A0;2.0‚Äù">‚ÄúPorqueira&#x00A0;2.0‚Äù</i> _will_ be ready soon.

Previously, I've written about one feature of Laurelin's pig sty: the [composting toilet](/laurelin-her-humanure/), where Lau collects her healthy humanure. Upon entering the pig entrance, the composting toilet is positioned in a little alcove at the right end of the sty. Laurelin constructed that outdent from bricks and cement‚Äîa ‚Äúgood exercise for the mill &#x1F628; ‚Äù, in her words. Everything left of that‚Äîincluding the entire back wall‚Äîis made up of stacked stones, glued together by a mix of gravity, clay and some morsels of cement.

![Everything left of Laurelin's [dry toilet in the making](/laurelin-her-humanure/) was proper stacked stone. (Jups, that's the same vantage point as in [<cite>Laurelin's humanure</cite>](/laurelin-her-humanure/).)](Ponte_de_Pedra_2017-11-14_View_of_toilet_along_the_back_wall_with_cruft.jpg){.text-width width="4032" height="2789"}

## Chip the cruft away.

As so often, with an original wall design rooted in poverty, the beautiful stone work was largely hidden behind an ugly, cementy crust, probably as soon as the builders could afford the cement. When Marilisa and I arrived at <i lang="pt">Ponte de Pedra</i> in November 2017, Laurelin had already been chipping away at that crust for some time, and pieces of the original wall had been revealed. With Laurelin busy working on her dry toilet, Marilisa and I could give in to the urge to peal that disgusting crust away.

## Chisel your shoulders into a wreck, or hack to the rhythm.

Marilisa‚Äîwho, in 2017, was around 25 kilogram lighter than me‚Äîwas less affected by stiffness and soreness while hammering her chisel than me. Granted, my tempo was a bit higher, but if you would extrapolate for strength and size, she would have been the faster, stronger chiseler. This brings me back 7 years, to 2010, when Jorrit and I spent a couple of weeks cleaning up and then repointing the stone walls of an old farm house in the Dordogne region in France. Back then, my right shoulder had been really sore from handling the pneumatic hammer days on end. (The hand-chisel was a relief compared with the so-typical static stress of a tool that runs on non-manual power.) The injury that flamed up in 2010 wasn't a new injury. And, even now, in 2018, it's not an old, long bygone injury, as I'm only just starting to get a grip on my shoulder stability and flexibility. With my currently evolving softer attitude towards shoulder rehab + prehab, I would have myself learn from Marilisa to hack not from a continuous tension‚Äîlike I am myself some sort of petrol-powered tool‚Äîbut from a point of relaxation between movements. Next time, I will see what animal rhythm I can step into rather than using myself like some pent-up machine.

[15:47, 2/24/2018] Rowan: Je kunt vast nog wel wat hulp met je appartement gebruiken.
[15:49, 2/24/2018] Laurelin: üôâ
[15:49, 2/24/2018] Laurelin: Schiet ongeveer een halve meter per dag op
[15:50, 2/24/2018] Rowan: Kan dit spul niet van de stenen afgeborstelt worden?
[15:50, 2/24/2018] Rowan: Want dan zou je sneller kunnen voegen en borstelen als het halfdroog is.
[16:24, 2/24/2018] Laurelin: Ja maar dan zie ik niet meer welke ste[e]n ik wil houden. Dus nu laat ik wel wat op de stenen komen en borstel ik dat er later af.
[19:36, 3/4/2018] Laurelin: Ik heb weer een dag geplijsterd
[19:37, 3/4/2018] Rowan: Cool.
[19:37, 3/4/2018] Laurelin: Nog minstens 7 volle dagen werk denk ik
[19:37, 3/4/2018] Rowan: Zoveel?
[19:37, 3/4/2018] Laurelin: Tja gaat met een kleine meter per dag
[19:37, 3/4/2018] Rowan: Dat was echt een dag per muur met Michel.
[19:38, 3/4/2018] Rowan: Met halfnat wegborstelen.
[19:39, 3/4/2018] Rowan: Klinkt heel ambachtelijk.
[19:39, 3/4/2018] Laurelin: Ja ik deeeenk dat ik of een noob ben, of dat deze muur een stuk hobbeliger is
[19:40, 3/4/2018] Rowan: Hoeft niet uit te maken, voor zover ik weet.
[19:40, 3/4/2018] Laurelin: üßê
[19:58, 3/4/2018] Laurelin: Hey maar on the upside krijg ik nou wel armspieren üòÖ
[19:59, 3/4/2018] Laurelin: Zelfs onderarmspieren üòé
[20:00, 3/4/2018] Rowan: Nais!
[20:00, 3/4/2018] Rowan: Ja, zoiets herinner ik me ook van toen.
[21:36, 3/5/2018] Laurelin: Ik kan me zo voorstellen dat als je handig bent met die kwak techniek, het een stuk sneller gaat, maar vooralsnog ben ik er vooral ingeslaagd er een zootje van te maken üòÇ
[21:36, 3/5/2018] Laurelin: Maar volgens mij heb ik nou wel bijna een derde van die muur af
[21:37, 3/5/2018] Laurelin: Ik wil het natuurlijk af hebben voor dat jullie er zijn he zodat ik trots kan pronken

Of course, immediately upon encountering this project, I started telling Laurelin about how amazingly professional our brother Jorrit and I are at cleaning up these old walls and repointing them with proper cement. I went to some length to brosplain the techniques we used when restoring the farm wall of <i lang="fr">La Maison du Michel</i> in France. (Just so you know: _brosplaining_ is not the same as mansplaining. I was merely trying to be helpful and brag at the same time. If you're looking for misogamy, look further. Another one of my sisters will be happy to femsplain to you where to look, you sexist <i>porco pequeno</i>.)

Disappointingly, Jorrit and I never got the opportunity to demonstrate our awesome techniques, which we had been fortunate enough to learn from Michel‚Äîan intelligent, experienced builder, who had moved from the Netherlands to restore that big, old farmhouse in the Dordogne. We were back in our respective countries‚ÄîFrance and the Netherlands‚Äîbefore Laurelin embarked on her own pointing journey. She mentioned that the process was slow and frustrating. When she followed my suggestion to use a flat board to hold the mortar and a pointing trowel to literally throw the mortar into the joints, she ended up with a lot of substance seeping over her stoned. The experience of her brothers turned out not to be so relevant after all: her mortar was a much softer, limier substance that what we had worked with. We were used to a tough, cementy substance, soft enough to throw deep into the joints, but hard enough not to drip out of the joints all over the stones. (Still, we went through _a lot_ of steel brushes to brush the half-hardened, freshly pointed joints out to just a bit below flush with the stone face.)

## Let the wall breathe.

Whereas Jorrit and I had learned to use your run-of-the mill cement mortar with some nice yellow sand for repointing, the Internet had taught Laurelin something else. The mortar we used was meant to make the outer wall solidly watertight, and also much stronger than it was previously. Plus, It had to look good‚Äîmuch better than before. Laurelin's mortar had to increase, not decrease the breathing ability of the wall. Plus, it had to look good‚Äîmuch better than before.

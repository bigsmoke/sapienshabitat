# How to flush a stone wall

It wasn't that Laurelin was longing back to her student days: the islands of clothes, inhabited by stuffed animals guarding abandoned books. Maybe she did miss the one island guarded by “Friemframfrutsel”, but I digress from the point I wish to make: she doesn't long back to living her life in the pig sty—<i lang="pt">porqueira</i> in Portuguese—that her room used to be. However, I am speaking here of a figurative <i lang="pt">porqueira</i>. She very much intends to move into a literal pig sty soon. Well, soon… Things move slowly around the <i lang="pt">Ponte de Pedra</i> valley. I planted “soon” here in March 2018. It's now November. And Laurelin has yet to move from the bunk bed in our mother's house to her “soon”-to-be cozy <i lang="pt" title="“Pig Sty&#x00A0;2.0”">“Porqueira&#x00A0;2.0”</i> mini-home. The next stop after <i lang="pt" title="“Pig Sty&#x00A0;2.0”">“Porqueira&#x00A0;2.0”</i> cannot be “sooned” by any stretch of the imagination: the 200&#x00A0;m² water mill, that ⓐ she [disappointingly](/deceit-or-disinterest/) still has to figure out how to get a building permit for that, and that ⓑ she then has to turn from a few ruined walls around a big pile of rubble into something … else. So, by that measure, <i lang="pt" title="“Pig Sty&#x00A0;2.0”">“Porqueira&#x00A0;2.0”</i> will be ready soon.

Previously, I've written about one feature of Laurelin's pig sty: the [composting toilet](/laurelin-her-humanure/), where Lau collects her healthy humanure. Upon entering the pig entrance, the composting toilet is positioned in a little alcove at the right end of the sty. Laurelin constructed that outdent from bricks and cement—a “good exercise for the mill &#x1F628; ”, in her words. Everything left of that—including the entire back wall—is made up of stacked stones, glued together by a mix of gravity, clay and some morsels of cement.

![Everything left of Laurelin's [dry toilet in the making](/laurelin-her-humanure/) was proper stacked stone. (Jups, that's the same vantage point as in [<cite>Laurelin's humanure</cite>](/laurelin-her-humanure/).)](Ponte_de_Pedra_2017-11-14_View_of_toilet_along_the_back_wall_with_cruft.jpg){.text-width width="4032" height="2789"}

## Chip the cruft away.

As so often, with an original wall design rooted in poverty, the beautiful stone work was largely hidden behind an ugly, cementy crust, probably as soon as the builders could afford it. When Marilisa and I arrived at <i lang="pt">Ponte de Pedra</i> in November 2017, Laurelin had already been chipping away at that crust for some time, and pieces of the original wall had been revealed. With Laurelin busy working on her dry toilet, Marilisa and I could give in to the urge to peal that disgusting crust away.

decided to take it upon ourselves to finish another job she had been working on: getting lots of more-or-less crappy cement and clay out of the seems of the rustic back wall that consists of field stones.

## Chisel until your shoulders are gone. Or, hack to the rhythm.

## Let the wall breathe.

Of course, immediately upon encountering this project, I started telling Laurelin about how amazingly professional our brother Jorrit and I are at cleaning up these old walls and refilling the seems with proper cement. I went to great lengths to brosplain the techniques we used on a restoration project in France and to defer to Jorrit wherever in doubt. (_Brosplaining_ is not the same as mansplaining. I was merely trying to be both helpful and brag. If you're looking for misogamy, look further. Another one of my sisters will be happy to femsplain to you where to look, you sexist <i>porco pequeno</i>.)

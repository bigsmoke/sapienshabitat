# One mill too many

One of the most exciting features of Annemarie her Portuguese property is the huge ruined water mill along the creek. Laurelin's ultimate plan is to use what's now mostly three and a half stone walls to erect a grand 200 m² building complex. She'll be living in an old pig sty with [composting toilet](/laurelin-her-humanure/) until she has sufficient savings to continue her Van der Molen lineage in the water mill. [‘Molen’ is Dutch for ‘mill’, in case you missed the pun.]

But, more excitement awaited… All the [unpleasant surprises](/deceit-or-disinterest/) about the main—supposedly ‘livable’—house (the one with the pig sty) were interspersed with a few unexpected turns of good luck. To get to know the full extend of this luck requires that we follow a winding path along the stream, starting at Laurelin's future mansion.

## Laurelin's ruin

Normally, under Portuguese law, you're allowed to resurrect a building of your choosing on a rubble, if a convincing case can be made that that rubble was once a ruin, which was once a building, which was situated in the same spot. The height of the new building doesn't matter, which is why you'll sometimes see otherwise nonsensically tall, multi-storied buildings in the remote countryside. The exact place and ground surface does matter, which is why, in the pre-cheap-satellite imagery era, ruins would sometimes spontaneously materialize at convenient building sites.

This information was sold to my mother when she bought the property. What they left out ([among other things](/deceit-or-disinterest/)) is that it's a bit more hairy to acquire a _licenção de habitação_ within _x_ meters from natural rivers, streams, etc. The aforementioned exemptions for acquiring a _licenção de habitação_ apply when the building or ruin has clearly been a home before, but alas, Laurelin's ruin used to be the main _lagar de azeite_ of the adjacent village, not a residence.  Obviously, the _lagar_ (water mill) was close to the stream.

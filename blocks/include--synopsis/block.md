Sapiens Habitat creates, maintains and restores beautiful
[gardens](/scale/garden), [landscapes](/scale/landscape) and
[wildernesses](/scale/wilderness) by applying well-grounded ecological insights
to the fullfillment of a very simple, but also very ambitious, mission:

> to improve the Earth environment, serving wildlife diversity while improving
> the longitudal abundance of the natural resources available to to <i>Homo
> sapiens</i>—the human species.

In other words:

> to recreate a more friendly, gardenesque version of the paradise in which our
> ancestors evolved, while leaving plenty of wilderness space for the
> continuation of the brutal evolutionary processes from which our own species
> emerged.

“Smart habitats for thinking humans.” That's what we're about.

And ‘we’ are, perhaps surprisingly, not a corporation. We're a 
[collective](/people). That's it. As such, we're not united in a legal entity.
You could consider us a brand—an unprotected brand, much like Anonymous, the
hacker collective. And while some of us—especially those for hire—may be
incorporated in various legal entities, having to obey different laws and
ideologies in many different areas, there's one concern that we all share: a
vision of a more glorious manifistation of the products of (both natural and
artifical) selection in our environment.

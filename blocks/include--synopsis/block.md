# Smart habitats for thinking humans

_Sapiens Habitat_ is where humans find
  - shelter in beautiful gardens,
  - awe in the spectacular landscapes that connect these gardens, and
  - their natural place in the intimidating wilderness that cross-cuts these landscapes.

_Sapiens Habitat_ is the mission of sapient beings around the globe:

> to improve the Earth environment, serving wildlife diversity while improving
> the longitudal abundance of the natural resources available to <i>Homo
> sapiens</i>—the human species.

In other words:

> to recreate a more friendly, gardenesque version of the paradise in which our
> ancestors evolved, while reserving plenty of wilderness space for the
> continuation of the brutal evolutionary processes from which our own species
> emerged.

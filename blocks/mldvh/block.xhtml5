  <p class="insert__p">Marilisa likes things that grow, as long as they are edible. And furry animals. Those she likes even if they're not on her plate. Her favorites? Cats, squirrels, goats, and maybe horses some day. Her favorite two are her flat mates: <a href="/cat-convict-conditioning/">Knabbel and Dinkie</a>. For a brief time, she was a guest author on Sapiens Habitat. Her newer writings can be found via <a href="https://marilisa.online/">marilisa.online</a>.</p>
